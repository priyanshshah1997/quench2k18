<p>
In depth understanding on prior art search <br>
Financial support for deserving projects/innovations<br>
Mentorship support<br>
Incubation support or support for working in the industry specific labs across Gujarat. <br></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
<p>Through carrying out Patent clinic at 4 different zones in GTU, the best innovative idea that are patent ready, but due to reasons like lack of resources, funds or knowledge, they would be getting a precious platform, and currently the conversion ratio towards actual Patents(granted)  is very less, so that problem also would be solved through the Patent Clinic, because after getting sensitised upon prior art search and drafting they can make their patent reports strong.. The goal is to identify the top 100 projects/ solutions who would be provides supports in all ways possible, could be financial, or maybe if mentorship is the key requirement.
