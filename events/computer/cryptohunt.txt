<p>CryptoHunt is an interesting event with a twist to the humdrum event of the classic treasure hunt. The clues for the event will be ciphered and the key would be given in the clue itself. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decrypt the clues, level by level to reach the final clue. Even the hints to the algorithms that are to be used would be given in the clue, respectively.
