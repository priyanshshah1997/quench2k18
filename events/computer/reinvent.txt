<h4>General Rules</h4><br>
<div  align="left">
1. A team with 4 members can only register. No individual participation is allowed.<br>
2. Every participating team should register with their team name.<br>

3. Every participating team has to appoint his team leader.<br>
4. re:Invent will consist of two rounds, each on Day 1 and Day 2. Round-1 will be an
elimination round, based on which the teams shall be selected for Round-2, which will be
the final round.<br>
5. The duration for both the rounds will be of 5 hours.<br>
6. Members are required to bring their own laptops and power extensions. Maximum of 4
laptops allowed in use at a time.<br>
7. Definitions will be given on the spot.<br>
8. All team members should be present at the event. Leaving the venue for some time to
hack elsewhere is fine. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers,
volunteers, sponsors, and others.<br>
9. All work on a project should be done at the re:Invent. Teams can use an idea they had
before the event.<br>
10. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a
project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code
during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.<br>
11. Teams must stop coding once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and
make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demo your hack you
find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it&#39;s okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.<br>
12. Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed.<br>
13. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers discretion. Reasons
might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code
of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.<br>
14. Soft copy of the project file in final working state to be provided in CD.<br>
15. Organisers or Institute will be liable to use the project for their purposes and will be
allowed to modify the code after the event.<br>
Rules are subject to last minute change. Contact corresponding coordinator(s) for further
inquiries. Final decision lies in hands of coordinators and judges. Participants have to abide the decision in all cases.
